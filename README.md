Fish Weight Prediction Project
Project Overview:

The Fish Weight Prediction Project is a machine learning based system that predicts the weight of a fish using its physical measurements such as length, height, and width. This project helps estimate fish weight quickly without using a weighing machine.

 Objective:

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate fish weight based on given input measurements.

Key Features:

Predicts fish weight using physical measurements.
Uses machine learning for accurate prediction.
Simple and user-friendly input system.
Fast and automatic calculation.
Useful for fisheries, sellers, and researchers.

 Technologies Used:

Python
Machine Learning (Regression Model)
Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for model training)

 Dataset:

The dataset contains different fish species along with their measurements such as:

Length
Height
Width
Actual Weight
The model learns from this data to predict weight for new inputs.

 How It Works:

Load and explore the dataset.
Clean and preprocess the data.
Train a machine learning model using fish measurements.
Test the model for accuracy.
Enter new fish measurements to predict weight.

 How to Run the Project:

Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib).
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
Enter fish measurement values.
View the predicted fish weight.

 Output:

The system displays the predicted weight of the fish based on the given measurements.
